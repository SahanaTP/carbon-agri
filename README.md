# Carbon Assessment and Measurement on Agriculture Using Big Data and Machine Learning!

The project focuses on agriculture's important role in the carbon cycle in order to meet the urgent need to reduce climate change.
Equilibrium between soil, plants, and the atmosphere is impacted by agricultural methods, which also affect carbon emissions and sequestration.
Labor-intensive and expensive nature of current carbon monitoring techniques has created a need for creative, effective, and scalable solutions.
